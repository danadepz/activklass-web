/**
 * Step 1 of /register — the two cards a person chooses between (T-32,
 * andecobs-48, and the same root as T-31 / andecobs-47).
 *
 * The tester's complaint was the signpost, not the flow: "Institution — A
 * school and its staff" reads as the card for a faculty member, who is staff
 * of a school, and four steps later they are sizing a subscription they never
 * meant to buy. So what is pinned here is what each card *promises* — that
 * Institution makes you the school's admin and issues its logins, and that
 * Individual covers a teacher whose school is not on ActivKlass yet. Wording
 * a tester read and misread is behaviour; it locks like any other.
 *
 * Static markup, the house pattern (PendingSchoolRequestNotice.test.jsx is
 * the model). Step 1 is the initial state, so no interaction is needed.
 *
 * The Faculty nudge on the school step is deliberately not here: it is gated
 * on `step` and `form.position`, three steps in, and the predicate it reads
 * (LEADERSHIP_POSITIONS) is module-private in a Shared file this pane does
 * not own. It stays a browser check — recorded as such in the ledger.
